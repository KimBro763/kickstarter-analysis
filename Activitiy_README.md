# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**

**Case Problem: Fundraising Campaigns** 

As an upcoming playwright, Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for her new play, Fever. To help with her first fundraising campaign, I am analyzing data to determine if there are specific factors that help campaigns achieve success. These insights will assist Louise in setting up a campaign using the factors that may contribute to success.  

 

***Initial Insights:***  
Great Britain is the better market for a theater campaign than the US. There were a total of 3038  campaigns in the US. Of these campaigns, 54% were successful with only 32% of successful campaigns being theater campaigns. Alternatively, while Great Britain only had 604 total campaigns, it also has a 61% success rate, with theater campaigns making up over 70% of the total for successful campaigns.

***Timeline:*** 

In both the US and Great Britain, May hosts the most successful theater campaign launches than any other month.  However, the trends for the rest of the year differ. In Great Britain, spring and summer months spike with successful theater campaign launches with peak successful launches in May and June. In the US, successful theater campaign launches peak in Ma and steadily decline throughout the rest of the year.

***Foresight” Play:*** 

To gain further insights into the Great Britain market, I analyzed a project similar to Louise’s scope and type. The “Foresight” play raised 722% of its original goal. It also had a low number of backers (17) with a high average donation amount ($849). The campaign lasted less than four weeks, suggesting a short campaign may be the most strategic.  

 

***5 Plays at Edinburgh Festival Fringe:*** 

At the Einburgh Festival Fringe, Louise was inspired by five plays. They were titled *Be Prepared*, *Checkpoint22*, *Cutting of Kate Bush*, *Jestia & Raedon*, and *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Family*. Of the five plays, all of them were successful campaigns. In addition, the goal amount for each play was low, falling between $1,000 and $4,000. 

 

***Successful and Failed Kickstarter Campaign Statistics:*** 

*Creating descriptive statistics for successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns provided a deeper analysis.  

*Failed Kickstarter campaigns had significantly higher campaign goals than successful campaigns. 

*Each distribution’s mean is around Q3, so the data all follows a similar distribution 

*The mean for failed goals is much higher than the median for failed goals, which means there may be outliers affecting the analysis.  

*The mean for successful campaign pledges is higher than the median for successful campaign pledges indicating potential outliers.  

 

***Researching Musicals in Great Britain:***  

I was un able to research musicals in Great Britain. Excel shuts down every time I try to create a boxplot. I have a tutoring appointment this week to get help with this.
